## CHANGES

### 2018/06/XX:
    - just learned how to AutoHotkey w/o jumping off the roof
    - shaking fists at AutoHotkey
    - reading of all combo and edit fields of the "Record Movie" tab
    - started reading the registry too
    - 80% of the "Record Movie" tab can now successfully be read
    - so much for a "hey, that'll only take 2..3 hours"
          


Have fun
